# Welcome!
Hi, I'm Filippo I live in a small city near Milan (IT). 
<br>
I'm a software developer, and my story starts about at the begining of 1990.<br />
More or less in that period, my parents gave me my first computer, the very old Comodore 64. Other the many game that I had play, i remember the [GEOS](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS) desktop publishing with which I wrote the scholl's  homework. I wrote my first program that I saw on a computer magazine, that program shown a ball that bounced in every border of the monitor, and during its journey deleted the word under it. It was very amazing for me 😃

From that period a lot of time has passed, I have changed many computers, 282, 486DX, Pentium, many types of Mac, PowerMac, iMac, PowerBook, MacBookAir, and during this period my intresting in a software developing is growth.

During the last years of my high school started the internet revolution, after the school's lesson, in the afternoon, me and my friends met togther in one first computer classrooms to develop the first web sites, using Microsoft Front Page and the base of html with the table to view the text.😏


After the school I had different type of work and in the middle of 2000 i decided to open my activity like as freelancer developer; the main focus of activity was a developing web sites. In that period the tecnology introduced the DIV to develop web pages, and for the server side one of possibilities were ASP Vbscript, PHP, Coldfusion, Java. During my freelancer period I folling in love 😍 for the Macromedia/Adobe Flash platform, for the simplicity to create a game, RIA (Rich internet application) or interactive web site. Moreover, in 2009 I had a Adobe certification on Adobe Flex Developer, i big goal for me 💥. 

For the last 10 years i have been working as a developer in big companies, and obviusly the technology still growing up, now I work with ASP.NET, or .NET for microservices and SQL Server for database. I design, plan and develop my assignaments every day.

In this period of my live beyond my daily work, I like keep me update on the technology, and in the recent years I restarted to studying and speaking english, because after the school I lost the capabilities on the enlgish language.

And last but not least I'm a scuba diver 🐠, is a wonderful activity; the underwater world is very strange 🐟, is fantastic 🐳!
